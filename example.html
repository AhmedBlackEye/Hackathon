                <h2>LAET and all its issues, from LATE homework to poor communication</h2>
                <p>As nice as some colleges, sixth forms, or any place of education can be, there’s always the same flaws that always appears across even the top achieving schools around Haringey like LAET, communication and homework/assignments. It’s no surprise that the standards of homework this top performing schools will be high as ever, as teachers set high aspirations for their students in hopes of them achieving the best results possible. However, recently, several LAET staff has been seeing drops in homework quality as the intensity of the workload increases. Students were asked about the issues and majority of the students had concluded that the reasoning behind poor homework was the lack of assistance and communications between themselves and teachers outside of school. Another common issue amongst the students were the lack of external teaching such as materials that cover topics as a follow up on their learning in lesson. Communication methods such as Emailing teachers is inconsistent and not very reliable at times</p>
                <p>Hey guys! So, as an A-Level English student, I've been feeling pretty frustrated lately. It's not that I don't love the subject, because I totally do! But, I feel like I'm not getting the support and attention I need to succeed.

                    For example, I've been struggling with a difficult concept in one of our texts, Lord of the Flies, and when I asked my teacher for help, I didn't really get the guidance I needed. And guess what? I ended up with a poor grade on the assignment. Can you believe that? It's frustrating and disheartening, and it makes me question whether I'm cut out for this course.
                    
                    And it's not just that, guys. I also feel like I don't have access to the resources and materials I need to complete my assignments and prepare for exams. It's tough to stay on track when I don't have the right books, articles, and other stuff. And, let's not even talk about the curriculum. Sometimes, it's too advanced for me, and other times, it's too simple and repetitive. It's like, come on, can't we find a happy medium here?
                    
                    Anyway, I just wanted to vent and let you all know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. I'm sure there are many other A-Level English students out there who can relate to my struggle. So, how about you guys? Have you been facing similar challenges as an A-Level English student? Let me know in the comments!
                    
                    As an A-Level student, I can tell you that it's no joke! There's so much pressure to perform well and get good grades, and it can be really overwhelming at times. The workload is intense, and it can be tough to keep up with everything. Not to mention, the lack of individualized attention from teachers can make it even harder to succeed. But even with all the challenges, it's also incredibly rewarding. It's a chance to really challenge yourself and push your limits. Plus, it's a great opportunity to make some amazing friends and create unforgettable memories. So, if you're an A-Level student, hang in there! It's tough, but it's worth it!
