Hey guys! So, as an A-Level English student, I've been feeling pretty frustrated lately. It's not that I don't love the subject, because I totally do! But, I feel like I'm not getting the support and attention I need to succeed.

For example, I've been struggling with a difficult concept in one of our texts, Lord of the Flies, and when I asked my teacher for help, I didn't really get the guidance I needed. And guess what? I ended up with a poor grade on the assignment. Can you believe that? It's frustrating and disheartening, and it makes me question whether I'm cut out for this course.

And it's not just that, guys. I also feel like I don't have access to the resources and materials I need to complete my assignments and prepare for exams. It's tough to stay on track when I don't have the right books, articles, and other stuff. And, let's not even talk about the curriculum. Sometimes, it's too advanced for me, and other times, it's too simple and repetitive. It's like, come on, can't we find a happy medium here?

Anyway, I just wanted to vent and let you all know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. I'm sure there are many other A-Level English students out there who can relate to my struggle. So, how about you guys? Have you been facing similar challenges as an A-Level English student? Let me know in the comments!

Plus, it's a great opportunity to make some amazing friends and create unforgettable memories. So, if you're an A-Level student, hang in there! It's tough, but it's worth it!

Alex, 18, The Henrietta Barnett School: Yeah, totally agree about the lack of support from teachers. It's whack.

Sarah, 19, Queen Elizabeth’s School, Barnet: I don't think the lack of individualized attention is a big deal. I've been able to succeed without it.

Josie, 17, The Tiffin Girls’ School: Yeah, I agree that access to the right resources is important, but I also think it's crucial to have a well-suited curriculum. Without both, it's so hard to learn and grow.
